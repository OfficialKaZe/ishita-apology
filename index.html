      <p>
        First of all I'm really sorry for making you feel this low. Mai kabhi nahi chahata aur na chahunga ki tere saath aisa kuch kabhi ho, because you're the most important person for me.
        Everything that I'm writing is my sincerity and nothing is me faking.
        Doing anything that hurts you makes me feel I'm breaking all those promises I said about always being with you and supporting you.
        I crumble completely when you cry.
        There are too many things I wanna say but I canâ€™t. But the main thing is I never wanna break your trust.
        I really want you to still be friends with me and me having the same importance in your life as I had earlier.
        <br><br>
        <em>P.S. Kittu ji, thanks for always being with me (I'm in tears writing all this sh)</em>
